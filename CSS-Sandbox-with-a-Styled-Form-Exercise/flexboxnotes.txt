Flexbox notes 

Modern layout mode in CSS3 

flex is a valud for the display property 
Replaces floats and is much more elegant 
to work with 
Align items both horizontally (row) and vertically 
(column)
Flex items can be reordered via CSS 

How it works ? 
display: flex; 
This creates a flex container 
All direct child items are flex items 

Align Properties 

justify-content: Align along the main axis (horizontal)
align-items : Align along the cross axis ( vertical)
align-content : Align when extra space in cross axis.
